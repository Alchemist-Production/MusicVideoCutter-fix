## 2024-05-22 - [Slider Directionality Confusion]
**Learning:** Sliders where "Intensity" implies "Frequency" but the underlying value controls "Period" (inverse relationship) are confusing. Users expect "More Intensity" = "Faster/More Action".
**Action:** Always label these controls by their direct unit (e.g. "Beats per Cut") or invert the logic so "Intensity" maps to the expected outcome.
